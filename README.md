# README

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](https://github.com/onebeyond/.github/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

This is the base template for our Open Source projects. If you want to create a new Open Source project, please, use this repo as the template, because it already has some features that should be shared across all the new repositories, such as:

- CODEOWNERS file
- dependabot file
- MIT license file
- Reference to the organization's Code of Conduct

And some others that will be added in the future.
